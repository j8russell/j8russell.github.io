            Hello to whomever stumbled upon this homepage. My name is listed above
            and I am college student at BSU. I study computer science and really enjoy
            the material but still struggle quite a bit. Hopefully, the more practice I 
            do the more effecient of a programmer I can become. My hobbies are basketball,
            football, techonology, fashion, fantasy sports, anime, and hip-hop. I also enjoy watching  
            movies and using social media apps. I want to learn how to make apps or video games because 
            I've always found both extremely interesting and fun. I'm new to HTML but I think it's 
            a pretty interesting computer language.
